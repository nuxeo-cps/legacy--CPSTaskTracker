CPSTaskTracker is a task tracker for CPS2 *AND* CPS3.

CPS2 :
------

This product has been developped for the CEA (French Center Atomic Center).
It was a part of the eDOC project (step 1) based on CPS2.

So notice it's been developped first for **CPS2**.

See the Software Requierement Specifications for this project in the docs
sub-folder of the product.

I would like to thank F.Jacquemet for the support during the developpement of
this component

CPS3 :
------

This product is now CPS3 compliant too.

A migration has been done and it's been an occasion to rechecked the
architecture of the product and to refactore it ;)

Check the DEPENDENCIES file for the specifics of the different versions.

You can check the difference in between the 2 frameworks (CPS2/CPS3) and see
how it's much more easier to develop the CPS3 one.
